# Performance Testing Using Cypress.io

Supporting materials for my session on Automation Guild 2021 where I will share how to extend Cypress to test for web performance.

## Pre-requisites

- [Node and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) [LTS version]
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) or any text editor of your choice

## Getting Started

To get started on the hands-on material, simply clone this repository, `cd` to the project root and then install the project dependencies by typing in `npm i` on your chosen terminal.

## Running The Tests

To open the Cypress Test Runner, simply type `npx cypress open` and select the file that you want to run.

Alternatively, to run it headlessly on Chrome, type `npx cypress run --browser chrome --headless`
